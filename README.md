# NODEMaple
NODEMaple consistes of a set of Maple workbooks and a library for structural design based on the Eurocode.
Currently the main development of the workbooks is focused on "Eurocode 5: Design of timber structures" with the Norwegian Annex.

If new to Maple, it is recommended to take a quick introduction tour through the software before using NODEMaple.

## Why NODE...?
The NODE prefix of the filenames is meant as a credit to my employer NODE rådgivende ingeniører AS, situated on the Norwegian west coast.

For more information see https://www.node.no.

NODE rådgivende ingeniører AS does neither own this software nor is legally responsible in any way.

# Installation
- A valid license of Maple (see https://www.maplesoft.com/products/Maple/) is required to run this software. Usually the latest release of the program is required.
- The software can be downloaded on GitHub: https://github.com/Anthrazit68/NODEMaple
- Before running the workbooks, NODElibrary needs to be installed or updated. This is done by running "Install NODELibrary.mw" once.
- After installing the library, it is recommended to exit Maple and start the program again.

# Usage
After installation of the library, the desired Maple workbooks can be opened and run. More information can be found on the opening pages of the specific workbooks.

# Contributing
This software has been made public in the hope of that it might be useful for other structural designers, professionals as well as students.
Everyone interested is very Welcome to contribute to this project.
As this project is done on a private and non commercial basis, please be aware that questions, contributions or suggestions might not be answered immediately or at all.

- You may use any programming environment of your choice, but I found the useage of Visual Code Editor with the Maple language support very useful.
