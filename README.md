# NODEMaple
NODEMaple consistes of a set of Maple workbooks and a library for structural design according to the rules of the Eurocode.
Currently the main development of the workbooks is focused on "Eurocode 5: Design of timber structures" with the Norwegian Annex.

If new to Maple, it is recommended to take a quick introduction tour through the software before using NODEMaple.

## Why NODE...?
The NODE prefix of the filenames is meant as a credit to my employer NODE rådgivende ingeniører AS. For more information see https://www.node.no.
NODE rådgivende ingeniører AS does neither own this software or is legally responsible in any way.
